Gingerbread Vendor Tree for DesireC (ERIS)

WARNING!  PLEASE DELETE THE "RECOVERY" FOLDER FROM THE ROM AFTER BUILD, BEFORE FLASHING OR DISTRO... thank you.
If anyone can help me keep recovery from being added to the rom, please msg me!

NOTE:  If you're going to use this as a standalone, please take the 'vendor' folder out of the tree
and drop it into the root of your build, overwriting any files.  If you don't do this, you won't
have any make options or 'product file' for DesireC (ERIS) and won't be able to build.

So to clearify...

- vendorsetup.sh (must be moved to /vendor/)
- AndroidProducts.mk & cyanogen_desirec.mk (must be moved to vendor/cyanogen/products)

Basic steps to build:

1 - Get local copy of CM7 respository
2 - Get copy of the device tree into device/htc/desirec
3 - Run get-rommanager in vendor/cyanogen directory
4 - Get proprietary files into 'vendor/htc/desirec/proprietary'
        a) Put ROM (update.zip) in repo root and run 'unzip-files.sh' from the 'device/htc/desirec' directory
        b) Use 'adb' to pull files from usb connected device by running 'extract-files.sh'
        c) Copy files from expanded system directory on your local machine by running 'copy-files.sh'
        d) Copy files from 'device/htc/desirec/proprietary' directory (also needs 'setup-makefiles.sh')
5 - Setup build environment by sourcing envsetup file '. build/envsetup.sh'
6 - Run Lunch to select the build target 'lunch cyanogen_desirec-eng'
7 - Build the system with 'make otapackage -j4'

NOTE: (the 4 is how many cpu cores you have + 1 ... I have a triple core for example)

Thanks to Conap & gnarlyc!
