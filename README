Gingerbread Vendor Tree for DesireC (ERIS)

NOTE:  Please cut the 'vendor' folder out of the tree and drop it into the root of your build, overwriting any files.
If you don't do this, you won't be able to build.

So to clearify...

- vendorsetup.sh (must be moved to /vendor/)
- AndroidProducts.mk & cyanogen_desirec.mk (must be moved to vendor/cyanogen/products)

Basic steps to build:

1 - Get local copy of CM7 respository
2 - Get copy of the device tree into device/htc/desirec
3 - Run get-rommanager in vendor/cyanogen directory
4 - Get proprietary files into 'vendor/htc/desirec/proprietary'
        a) Put ROM (update.zip) in repo root and run 'unzip-files.sh' from the 'device/htc/desirec' directory
        b) Use 'adb' to pull files from usb connected device by running 'extract-files.sh'
        c) Copy files from expanded system directory on your local machine by running 'copy-files.sh'
        d) Copy files from 'device/htc/desirec/proprietary' directory (also needs 'setup-makefiles.sh')
5 - Setup build environment by sourcing envsetup file '. build/envsetup.sh'
6 - Run Lunch to select the build target 'lunch cyanogen_desirec-eng'
7 - Build the system with 'mka bacon'

Thanks to Conap & gnarlyc!
